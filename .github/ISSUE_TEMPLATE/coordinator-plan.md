## Context
Link to `docs/RFC/index.yaml` and any recent state changes.

## Ask to Coordinator
- Compute the executable set (RFCs with all `requires` satisfied)
- Propose 2–3 parallel tasks and open issues with task briefs
- Include dependencies, DoD, and file boundaries in each brief

## Constraints
- PR size ≤ 5 files unless RFC allows larger
- Tests-first; quality gates must pass

## Notes
Optional preferences on which RFCs to prioritize.
