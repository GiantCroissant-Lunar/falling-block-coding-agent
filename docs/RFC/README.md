# RFCs

Lightweight RFC process for planning and coordinating agent-driven development. Keep RFCs short, focused, and with a crisp Definition of Done (DoD).

- Location: `docs/RFC`
- Naming: `NNNN-title-kebab-case.md` (zero-padded number)
- States: Draft → Approved → Implementing → Review → Done (or Rejected)
- Dependencies: Track in front-matter and `index.yaml` (requires/blocks)
- Groups: Optional grouping for parallelization; a group may be linear or parallel

See `TEMPLATE.md` for structure and `index.yaml` for the planning graph.
